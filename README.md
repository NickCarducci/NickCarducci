### Hi there 👋

I am running for US Senate in 2025 and I need your help to get on the ballot!
If you are a New Jersey voter who agrees that ↙️⚪️🏞
* invoices are theft,
* amortize accrual to reality 
  - capital loss deflation (cash/debt)*income every year back,
  - welfare investment bank 44%, 56% still invoices,
    > Obamacare/price-controls are pennywise cheaper than ending insurance investment banks for a pound, of efficiency, GDP/hour-GDP/p, productivity, (income/hour)home.
    - borrower defense (force-majeure intent)
    - donee beneficiary-surrendered-freedom
  -  assets:liabilities $0:$0, 
    > efficient economies make nominal, but not actual, positive balances of trade (Froth.app, U.S. BEA)
* Savers' land-deeds are 20% of the U.S.; 11/12 exploration/drilling rights by a General Maintenance Unit
> 12 industry variance permits by minimal viable product duress of quality, or network/horizontal designation for "operational monopsony" target-margins

please petition & I will write the Efficiency Act in office!
