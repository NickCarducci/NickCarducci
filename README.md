### Hi there 👋

I am running for US Senate in (Truncated Production Tax) 2025 and I need your help to get on the ballot!
If you are a New Jersey voter who agrees that ↙️⚪️🏞
* 19% is not actually "disabled,"
* -GDP/p change-rate is tech advancement,
* poverty is equality, competition, and [1800-1913](https://vaults.biz/gdp) GDP/p 3%/yr+ population proves **people are economic for people**,
* invoices are theft,
* implausible use **beyond 5 storefronts and condominiums** is intent-prosecutable,
* accrual is not reality,
  - **reverse amortize** capital loss deflation (cash/debt)\*income every year back,
  - [welfare investment bank 44%](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/2020/tr20summary.pdf#page=17), 56% still invoices,

    > [Obamacare/price-controls are pennywise, -cheaper](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/111th-congress-2009-2010/costestimate/amendreconprop.pdf#page=14), than ending insurance investment banks for a pound, of efficiency, [GDP/hour-GDP/p](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=LmzU), productivity, [(income/hour)home](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=M7mh), only because Supply already doesn't equate Labor-Demand, but for:
    - borrower defense (force-majeure intent)
    - donee beneficiary-surrendered-freedom
  -  assets:liabilities $0:$0, 
    > efficient economies make nominal, but not actual, positive balances of trade (Froth.app, U.S. BEA),
* Savers' land-deeds are 20% of the U.S.; 11/12 exploration/drilling rights by a General Maintenance Unit,
> 12 industry variance permits by minimal viable product duress of quality, or network/horizontal designation for "operational monopsony" target-margins,
* animals can be saved with open ingredient licensure:
  - Transaction-fee-based security depositary receipt requires NO prescription costs!
* Article 1.8 equal bond-tax and Tranquil and voluntary trade means equal in receipt and scope, 

  - exclusive Truncated Production Tax geohash/mo precinct-spoofable 3% under $2k is: 

    - not hypocritical state victimization and criminalization over the Public,

      > only ever Science, and 501c3 dissolving to the state is not tax deductible, neither are interest payments for [Adjusted Present Value](https://qr.ae/pGjS4s), per diem incarceration, nor homelessnesss-scapegoating usurer-finance (insurer, lender, landlord) for mental-aquity!

please petition [carducci.us/primary](carducci.us/primary) & I will write the Efficiency Act in office!
