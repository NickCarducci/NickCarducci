# 👋 Hi, I’m Nicholas Matthew Carducci

I'm a civic technologist, independent U.S. Senate candidate (NJ 2026), and graduate software engineering student at Monmouth University. I’m passionate about building public-interest technology and data commons for democratic participation, transparency, and justice.

## 🧠 What I'm Working On

### 🇺🇸 Thumbprint Social Calendar
Since 2012, I've been researching, designing, and developing **Thumbprint Social Calendar** — a voting and streaming platform for:
- Real-time and archival **court cases**, **elections**, and **mock referenda**
- Featuring **unbiased** bill, ordinance, and budget proposal verbiage
- Designed to promote **civic engagement** and **institutional accountability** through structured public feedback

This project is the backbone of my public service campaign and a proof-of-concept for a **New Commons** based on verified democratic input.

### 🛡 Guardian Angel App
I’m also working on the **Guardian Angel Data Commons**, an open-source safety and transparency app proposed to the [NewCommons.ai Challenge](https://newcommons.ai). It enables secure, collaborative community oversight and real-time alerts for vulnerable environments using:
- ReactJS + Node.js
- Firebase & Azure (Entra ID, Firestore, SQL, Functions)
- SwiftUI & Kotlin for mobile

## 🎓 Current Studies at Monmouth University (M.S. Software Engineering, ‘26)

Courses Completed:
- ⚙️ Real-Time Embedded Systems
- 🤖 Low Code / No Code AI & ML
- 🧮 Data Structures & Algorithms
- 🌐 Computer Networks

My academic work focuses on **scalable civic platforms**, **secure edge computing**, and **intelligent interfaces** for ethical tech.

## 💡 Technical Stack

**Languages & Frameworks**  
- JavaScript / TypeScript, Node.js, ReactJS  
- SwiftUI, Kotlin (cross-platform mobile)  
- Python (data / backend scripting), C/C++ (embedded)  
- SQL, Firestore, GraphQL

**Platforms & Tools**  
- Firebase, Azure (SQL, Entra ID, Functions)  
- Digital Ocean Apps, GitHub Actions  
- Unity, Infinigen, and procedural generation tools for simulation

## 🗳 Why I'm Running for Senate

I'm not just building software—I’m building infrastructure for **trust**, **verification**, and **collective decision-making**. Politics needs technologists who care about the **integrity of systems**, not just the outcomes. My campaign platform draws from over a decade of independent civic R&D.
