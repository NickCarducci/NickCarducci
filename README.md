### Hi there 👋

I am running for US Senate in (Truncated Production Tax) 2025 and I need your help to get on the ballot!
If you are a New Jersey voter who agrees that ↙️⚪️🏞
* -GDP/p change-rate is tech advancement,
* poverty is equality, competition, and [1800-1913](https://vaults.biz/gdp) GDP/p 3%/yr+ population proves **people are economic for people**,
* invoices are theft,
* implausible use **beyond 5 storefronts and condominiums** is intent-prosecutable,
* accrual is not reality,
  - **reverse amortize** capital loss deflation (cash/debt)\*income every year back,
  - welfare investment bank 44%, 56% still invoices,

    > [Obamacare/price-controls are pennywise, -cheaper](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/111th-congress-2009-2010/costestimate/amendreconprop.pdf#page=14), than ending insurance investment banks for a pound, of efficiency, GDP/hour-GDP/p, productivity, (income/hour)home, only because Supply already doesn't equate Labor-Demand
    - borrower defense (force-majeure intent)
    - donee beneficiary-surrendered-freedom
  -  assets:liabilities $0:$0, 
    > efficient economies make nominal, but not actual, positive balances of trade (Froth.app, U.S. BEA)
* Savers' land-deeds are 20% of the U.S.; 11/12 exploration/drilling rights by a General Maintenance Unit
> 12 industry variance permits by minimal viable product duress of quality, or network/horizontal designation for "operational monopsony" target-margins

please petition [carducci.us/primary](carducci.us/primary) & I will write the Efficiency Act in office!
